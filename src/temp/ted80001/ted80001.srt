2
00:00:09.668-->00:00:17.786
subtitle(autocreated) wj3235@126.com) =>     i am in search of another planet in the universe where life exists,

3
00:00:17.786-->00:00:25.325
subtitle(autocreated) wj3235@126.com) =>     ican'tsee this planet with my naked eyes,or even with the most powerful telescopes we currently possess,

4
00:00:25.325-->00:00:27.406
subtitle(autocreated) wj3235@126.com) =>     but i know thatit'sthere,

5
00:00:27.406-->00:00:32.676
subtitle(autocreated) wj3235@126.com) =>     and understanding contradictions that occur in nature will help find,

6
00:00:32.676-->00:00:36.456
subtitle(autocreated) wj3235@126.com) =>     on our planet where there is water there is life,

7
00:00:36.456-->00:00:41.564
subtitle(autocreated) wj3235@126.com) =>     so we look for planets that orbit at just the right distance from their stars,

8
00:00:41.564-->00:00:54.209
subtitle(autocreated) wj3235@126.com) =>     at this distance shown in blue on this diagram for stars of different temperatures planets could be warm enough for water to flow on their surfaces has lakes and oceans where life might reside,

9
00:00:54.209-->00:01:00.609
subtitle(autocreated) wj3235@126.com) =>     some astronomers focus their time and energy on finding planets that these distances from their stars,

10
00:01:00.609-->00:01:03.490
subtitle(autocreated) wj3235@126.com) =>     what i do takes up where their job ends,

11
00:01:03.490-->00:01:06.921
subtitle(autocreated) wj3235@126.com) =>     i model the possible climates affect the planet,

12
00:01:06.921-->00:01:15.641
subtitle(autocreated) wj3235@126.com) =>     andhere'swhythat'simportant there are many factors besides distance from its star that control whether a planet can support life,

13
00:01:15.641-->00:01:17.987
subtitle(autocreated) wj3235@126.com) =>     take the planet venus,

14
00:01:17.987-->00:01:26.071
subtitle(autocreated) wj3235@126.com) =>     IT'snamed after the roman goddess of love and beauty because of its benign if serial appearance in the sky,

15
00:01:26.071-->00:01:29.681
subtitle(autocreated) wj3235@126.com) =>     but spacecraft measurements revealed a different story,

16
00:01:29.681-->00:01:35.580
subtitle(autocreated) wj3235@126.com) =>     the surface temperature is close to nine hundred degrees fahrenheit five hundred celsius,

17
00:01:35.580-->00:01:38.658
subtitle(autocreated) wj3235@126.com) =>     that'shot enough to melt lead,

18
00:01:38.658-->00:01:49.731
subtitle(autocreated) wj3235@126.com) =>     its thick atmosphere not its distance from the sun is the reason causes the greenhouse effect on steroids trapping heat from the sun is scorching the planet surface,

19
00:01:49.731-->00:01:55.124
subtitle(autocreated) wj3235@126.com) =>     the reality totally contradicted initial perceptions on this planet,

20
00:01:55.124-->00:02:04.303
subtitle(autocreated) wj3235@126.com) =>     from these lessons from our own solar systemwe'velearned that aplanet'satmosphere is crucial to its climate and potential to host life,

21
00:02:04.303-->00:02:14.090
subtitle(autocreated) wj3235@126.com) =>     wedon'tknow what the atmospheres of these planets are like because the planets are so small in game compared to their stars,and so far away from us,

22
00:02:14.090-->00:02:28.739
subtitle(autocreated) wj3235@126.com) =>     for example one of the closest planet that could support surface water is called least six six seven cc touch a glamorous name write, my phone number for a nameit'stwenty three light years away,

23
00:02:28.739-->00:02:32.122
subtitle(autocreated) wj3235@126.com) =>     sothat'smore than one hundred trillion miles,

24
00:02:32.122-->00:02:39.088
subtitle(autocreated) wj3235@126.com) =>     trying to measure the atmospheric composition of expo planet passing in front of its host star is hard,

25
00:02:39.088-->00:02:43.601
subtitle(autocreated) wj3235@126.com) =>     IT'slike trying to see a fruit fly passing in front of cars headlight,

26
00:02:43.601-->00:02:51.870
subtitle(autocreated) wj3235@126.com) =>     they now imagine that cause one hundred trillion miles away and you want to know the precise color of the fly,

27
00:02:51.870-->00:03:00.597
subtitle(autocreated) wj3235@126.com) =>     so i use computer models to calculate the kind of atmosphere a planet would need you have suitable climate for water and life,

28
00:03:00.597-->00:03:06.964
subtitle(autocreated) wj3235@126.com) =>     here'sanartist'sconcept of the planet kepler sixty to ask with your for reference,

29
00:03:06.964-->00:03:11.925
subtitle(autocreated) wj3235@126.com) =>     IT'stwelve hundred light years away and just forty percent larger than earth,

30
00:03:11.925-->00:03:25.692
subtitle(autocreated) wj3235@126.com) =>     or in excess funded work found that IT could be warm enough for open water for many types of atmospheres and orientations of its orbit to live like feature telescope to follow up on this planet to look for signs of life,

31
00:03:25.692-->00:03:35.357
subtitle(autocreated) wj3235@126.com) =>     i am on a planet surface is also important for climate, absorb longer redder wavelengths of light and reflects shorter bluer light,

32
00:03:35.357-->00:03:45.607
subtitle(autocreated) wj3235@126.com) =>     that'swhy the iceberg in the photo looks so blue the redder light from the sun is absorbed on its way through the ice only the blue light makes IT all the way to the bottom,

33
00:03:45.607-->00:03:50.111
subtitle(autocreated) wj3235@126.com) =>     then a gets reflected back up to our eyes when we see blue wife,

34
00:03:50.111-->00:04:03.836
subtitle(autocreated) wj3235@126.com) =>     my model show that planets orbiting cooler stars could actually be warmer than planets orbiting hotter stars she does another contradiction that ice absorbs the longer wavelength light from cooler stars that light that energy,

35
00:04:03.836-->00:04:05.789
subtitle(autocreated) wj3235@126.com) =>     heats the ice,

36
00:04:05.789-->00:04:15.437
subtitle(autocreated) wj3235@126.com) =>     using climate models,to explore how these contradictions can affect planetary climate is vital to the search for life elsewhere,

37
00:04:15.437-->00:04:17.644
subtitle(autocreated) wj3235@126.com) =>     andit'sno surprise that this,

38
00:04:17.644-->00:04:19.380
subtitle(autocreated) wj3235@126.com) =>     my specialty,

39
00:04:19.380-->00:04:33.401
subtitle(autocreated) wj3235@126.com) =>     i'mafrican american female astronomer,and a classically trained actor who love to wear make up and read fashion magazines so i am uniquely positioned to appreciate contradictions in nature,

40
00:04:33.401-->00:04:41.939
subtitle(autocreated) wj3235@126.com) =>     the,and how they can inform our search for the next planet where life exists,

41
00:04:41.939-->00:04:48.399
subtitle(autocreated) wj3235@126.com) =>     my organization rising star girls teaches astronomy to middle school girls of color,

42
00:04:48.399-->00:04:52.272
subtitle(autocreated) wj3235@126.com) =>     using theatre writing and visual arts,

43
00:04:52.272-->00:05:03.278
subtitle(autocreated) wj3235@126.com) =>     that'sanother contradiction science and artdon'toften go together but interweaving them can help these girls bring their whole selves to what a large and maybe one day,

44
00:05:03.278-->00:05:13.415
subtitle(autocreated) wj3235@126.com) =>     join the ranks of astronomers were full of contradictions can use a background to discover once and for all that we are truly not alone in the universe,

45
00:05:13.415-->00:05:26.992
subtitle(autocreated) wj3235@126.com) =>     thank you,the,
